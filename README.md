# Data-Visualization-to-Forecast-Withdrawals-in-a-Bike-Sharing-System-Mexico-City-Case

# ABSTRACT
In this paper we predict the aggregated withdrawals of
Mexico bike-sharing system, called Ecobici, for a given
day. The principal problem adressed was the lack of data
available to understand certain behavior related to the
system demand at some time of the day. However, with
the information available in the Ecobici website we were
capable to adjust a time series model that help us forecast
the aggregated withdrawals in the short time and midel
tiem, this can be used to estimate the overall demand for
a given hour in the day in order to identify the time of the
day when the demand of bicycles is greater than the
availability. The principal motivation of our analysis is
to be capable to predict the aggregated demand of
bicycles.
Keywords: Ecobici system, aggregated withdrawals,
time series.
